## [Shebang](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Shebang)

The #! syntax used in scripts to indicate an interpreter for execution under UNIX / Linux operating systems. Most Linux shell and [perl](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Perl) / [python](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/Python) script starts with the following line:

```
#!/bin/bash
```

OR

```
#!/usr/bin/perl
```

OR

```
#!/usr/bin/python
```

OR

```
#!/usr/bin/python3
```

OR

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

**/usr/bin/env bash**

The /usr/bin/env run a program such as a bash in a modified environment. It makes your bash script portable. The advantage of #!/usr/bin/env bash is that it will use whatever bash executable appears first in the running user's $PATH variable.
