## Bits, Bytes, and Integers

- Representing information as bits
- Bit-level manipulations
- Integers
  - Representation: unsigned and signed
  - Conversion, casting
  - Expanding, truncating
  - Addition, negation, multiplication, shifting
  - Summary
- Representations in memory, pointers, strings

公式表述是关键



两者映射关系 注意课本p46分析逻辑

 unsigned & Two's Complement 比较的时候



- Bit pattern is maintained
- But reinterpreted
- Can have unexpected effects: adding or subtracting 2^w
- Expression containing signed and unsigned int
  - int is cast to unsigned!!
