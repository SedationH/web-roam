初步体验自动化带来的好处



使用逻辑能力更强大的scss

> Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables), [nested rules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules#nesting), [mixins](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/mixin), [functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules), and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.



> Sass supports two different syntaxes. Each one can load the other, so it's up to you and your team which one to choose.
>
> - .scss
> - .sass
