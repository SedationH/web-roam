If the idea of self-studying 9 topics over multiple years feels overwhelming, we suggest you focus on just two books: *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective* and *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*. In our experience, these two books provide incredibly high return on time invested, particularly for self-taught engineers and bootcamp grads working on networked applications. They may also serve as a "gateway drug" for the other topics and resources listed above.
